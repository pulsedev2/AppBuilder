# AppBuilder

![Last build](https://github.com/pulsedev2/AppBuilder/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg)

AppBuilder is an open-source IDE to create your own app with ease.

It includes a blue-prints system to script your application, and a drag drop interface to make app creation easier.

## Blue Prints

Actually WIP, but we are aiming to a full node & block system, where anyone will be able to create its own complex script.

## Drag & Drop

Drag & Drop interface is currently WIP, but it the future you will be able to make your application easily just by dragging each component where you want.

The Drag & Drop interface will include a tag editor to manage deeper each component of your application.
